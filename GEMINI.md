# GEMINI.md - Project Context & Directives

## Project Identity
**Name**: 3D Spring Emulator
**Goal**: Create a satisfying, realistic simulation of a doorstop spring.

## Key Characteristics
1.  **The "Boing"**: The most important feature is the physics. It must feel "springy" and satisfying to flick.
2.  **Visuals**: Should look like the reference images (metallic, coiled, white rubber tip).
3.  **Interaction**: Mouse/Touch interaction to pull back and release the spring.

## Technical Directives
- **Framework**: Vanilla Three.js or React Three Fiber.
- **Physics**: Cannon-es or custom Verlet integration.
- **Code Style**: Modular, typed (TypeScript), clean.

## Reference Images
